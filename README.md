## About Sweety

Sweety is a simple project which takes its cue from <a href="https://github.com/laracasts/Tweety">Tweety</a> by Jeffrey Way of Laracasts.

I propose it again under the latest Laravel version instead the old version 6.

I just wanted to share it, my goal for the curent year is mastering Laravel and it's ecosystem.

bye n' ty
